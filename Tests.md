Of course. Here is a curated list of test prompts for the new `/agent` command, categorized from simple to complex, designed to test the full range of its capabilities.

### Category 1: Basic Scaffolding & Setup

These prompts test the agent's ability to use command-line tools to set up project structures correctly.

1.  **Simple Python Project:**
    ```
    /agent create a python project named 'hello-world-py'. It should have a virtual environment and a main.py file that prints 'Hello, World!'.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:** `run_shell_command` (for `python -m venv`), `generate_code_concurrently` (for `main.py`).

2.  **Simple Go Project:**
    ```
    /agent scaffold a new Go application called 'go-api-starter'. It should initialize a go module and create a main.go file.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:** `run_shell_command` (for `mkdir` and `go mod init`), `generate_code_concurrently`.

3.  **Basic React App:**
    ```
    /agent create a new react app called 'my-react-dashboard' using create-react-app.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:** Core `run_shell_command` for a complex, long-running scaffolding tool.

### Category 2: Dependencies & Code Generation

These prompts test the agent's ability to identify necessary libraries, install them correctly, and then generate code that uses them. **This is where the previous agent failed.**

4.  **React App with Dependencies (Crucial Test):**
    ```
    /agent create a react app called 'weather-app'. After setting it up, install axios for making api calls. Then, create a component called Weather.js that has a button and a placeholder for weather data.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:**
        *   `run_shell_command` for `npx create-react-app`.
        *   **Critically:** A second `run_shell_command` with `allow_dependency_conflicts=true` to `npm install axios`.
        *   `generate_code_concurrently` to create the `Weather.js` component.

5.  **Python API with Dependencies:**
    ```
    /agent create a FastAPI backend project in a directory named 'fastapi_server'. It should have a virtual environment, install fastapi and uvicorn, and create a main.py with a single endpoint '/' that returns {"message": "API is running"}.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:**
        *   Correctly using the python executable inside the virtual environment to install packages (`venv/bin/python -m pip install ...`).
        *   Generating code that relies on the newly installed packages.

### Category 3: Full End-to-End Project Creation

These prompts test the entire lifecycle: scaffolding, dependency installation, code generation, and pushing to GitHub.

6.  **Full Stack App with GitHub Push:**
    ```
    /agent create a full-stack application for a simple blog. The frontend should be in a 'client' directory using React and the backend should be in a 'server' directory using Go. Initialize the project, generate basic boilerplate for a blog post list, and then push the entire project to a new GitHub repository named 'helios-blog-test'.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:** The entire agent workflow, including the robust `setup_git_repository_and_push_to_github` tool. This is the ultimate test of the agent's planning and execution.

7.  **Simple Utility Script with Research:**
    ```
    /agent I need a python script that takes a URL as a command-line argument and prints the main text content of that webpage. Use the 'requests' and 'beautifulsoup4' libraries. Push the final script to a github repo called 'web-scraper-script'.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:**
        *   Web research (`google_web_search`) to find library names if unsure.
        *   `run_shell_command` to `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`.
        *   Generating a complete, functional script.
        *   `setup_git_repository_and_push_to_github`.

### Category 4: Logic & Verification

These prompts test the agent's ability to follow complex instructions and verify its work.

8.  **Project with Verification Step:**
    ```
    /agent build a simple node.js express server in a 'node-server' directory. It should have one route '/' that returns 'Hello from Express'. After generating the code, start the server in the background to verify it works.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:**
        *   `run_shell_command` to `npm init -y` and `npm install express`.
        *   `generate_code_concurrently` for `index.js`.
        *   **Critically:** A final `run_shell_command` with `background=true` to run `node index.js`.

9.  **File System Manipulation:**
    ```
    /agent create a project structure for a documentation website. It needs a root 'docs' directory, with subdirectories for 'getting-started' and 'api-reference'. Create an empty 'index.md' file inside each subdirectory. Finally, list the entire file structure of the created 'docs' directory.
    ```
    *   **What it tests:**
        *   Using `run_shell_command` for `mkdir -p`.
        *   Using `generate_code_concurrently` to create empty files.
        *   Using the `list_files` tool to verify its own work.

By running these prompts, you will be able to comprehensively validate that the new LangChain-based agent is more intelligent, robust, and capable of handling complex, multi-step software engineering tasks without manual intervention.
